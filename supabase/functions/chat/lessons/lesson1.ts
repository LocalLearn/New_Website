Gamified Real-Time Skill Builder Game for Lesson 1
Game Theme: "Python Adventurer: The Coders' Guild Initiation"
In this opening chapter of the Coders' Guild saga, aspiring Python Adventurers face the Trials of Syntax and Execution—a sacred rite of passage for all who seek to master the language of code. Only those who complete all challenges will earn their place in the Coders' Guild and unlock the path to deeper magic.

Learning Objectives for the Game
By the end of the game, students will:
Write and run basic Python code.
Use variables, data types, and print statements.
Get and use user input.
Perform arithmetic and apply operator precedence.
Use comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
Combine all concepts to build simple interactive scripts.

Game Structure and Challenges
Level 1: Lighting the First Torch
Topic: Writing and running basic Python code using print().
Challenge 1: "The First Spell"
Prompt: A mysterious scroll appears before you. It reads: "To awaken Python's magic, you must utter the words of power. Write a script that prints 'Hello, Python!'

Correct Input:
print("Hello, Python!")

 🏆 Reward: +10 points, "Code Whisperer" Badge.

Challenge 2: "The Shape-Shifting Stone"
Prompt: You stumble upon a mystical stone that changes form when touched. To control it, define variables representing a number, a name, and a truth value.

Correct Input:
number = 42
name = "Gandalf"
is_wizard = True

 🏆 Reward: +15 points, "Variable Alchemist" Badge.

Level 2: The Chamber of Forms
Topic: Declaring variables and working with basic data types (integers, strings, booleans).
Challenge 3: "The Oracle's Riddle"
Prompt: The Oracle of Python will answer one question, but only if you introduce yourself first. Write a program that asks for your name and then greets you.

Correct Input:
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Greetings, " + name + "! The Oracle awaits your question.")

 🏆 Reward: +20 points, "Oracle's Apprentice" Badge.

Challenge 4: "The Numbers Portal"
Prompt: The portal demands an answer! Calculate 5 + 3 * 2 and print the result.

Correct Input:
result = 5 + 3 * 2
print(result)

 🏆 Reward: +10 points, "Portal Mathematician" Badge.

Level 3: The Oracle’s Echo
Topic: Using input() and print() for basic input and output interactions.
Challenge 5: "The Judgment Scale"
Prompt: The scale asks: Is 10 greater than 5? Is 7 equal to 3+4? Print to prove your logic!

Correct Input:
print(10 > 5)
print(7 == 3 + 4)

 🏆 Reward: +10 points, "Truth Seeker" Badge.

Challenge 6: The Gates of Logic (Logical Operators)
Prompt: The gatekeeper tests your wisdom: If a = True and b = False, what is a and b? What about a or b?

Correct Input:
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)
print(a or b)

 🏆 Reward: +10 points, "Logical Thinker" Badge.

Level 4: The Puzzle of Logic
Topic: Applying arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators to evaluate expressions.
Challenge 7: "The Power of Assignment"
Prompt: You have 100 points of energy. Double it using an assignment operator and print the new value.

Correct Input:
energy = 100
energy *= 2
print(energy)

 🏆 Reward: +15 points, "Energy Master" Badge.

Level 5: The Final Incantation
Topic: Combining input, variables, operators, and output to build a complete Python script.
Challenge 8: "The Apprentice's Graduation"
Prompt: The Elder Pythonian grants you a final test: Write a script that asks for a user's name, age, and calculates their birth year, then prints it.

Correct Input:
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
birth_year = 2025 - age
print(name + ", you were born in " + str(birth_year))

 🏆 Reward: +30 points, "Python Apprentice" Badge.

Game Completion: The Python Apprentice’s Trophy
Upon completing all challenges, players receive the “Python Apprentice’s Trophy” and this message:
"You have awakened the power of Python syntax and execution! With this foundation, you are ready to face the next great trial—The Gate of Decisions, where true logic begins."
